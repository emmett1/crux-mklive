# crux-mklive
live iso maker for CRUX

Like the title said, this scripts make custom live iso for CRUX GNU/Linux (should works in any distros actually, but this
one focussed on CRUX only) using busybox based initramfs, squashed rootfs and etc.

This script might need more touch. This is all for now, i just throw it in here in case anybody wanna try it.

Host requirements:
- syslinux - need isohybrid
- grub - for setup UEFI stuffs
- squashfs-tools - for squshing rootfs
- curl - for fetch busybox
- imagemagick - to create custom splash image (optional)
- cdrkit - need genisoimage to create the iso
- pkg-get - to prepare custom CRUX rootfs (optional if you can do other way, like using prt-get)
- qemu - for testing the iso (optional)

Target live rootfs requirements:
- kernel - to boot the live iso (recommended generic one, so support more hardware)
- grub-efi - to boot in UEFI mode
- squashfs-tools - to install into disk (optional if you not planning to install into disk)
- chpasswd - to change live password (its part of 'shadow' package but CRUX remove it by default, you can get from my repo)

some required package might not in official crux repos, but you can get from my repo:

So how to do it?

Basically just run 'sudo ./prepare-rootfs.sh' then 'sudo ./mklive.sh'.

But in details;
- first you need to setup 'pkg-get', i'm not gonna teach you that.
- you might want to modify 'package.*' files to include into your live iso. 'packages.opt', 'packages.xorg' is taken from
  official crux iso. 'package.custom' is for custom packages. Note: read 'prepare-rootfs.sh' script. modify rootfs less as
  possible, because any modification should made in 'live-script.sh' script and 'liverootfs' directory.
- modify 'files/live-script.sh' script if needed. this script is executed while inside initramfs before live rootfs boots.
  so any command here only happen on live environment, like creating live user, setup hostname, locale and etc.
- add any customization in 'liverootfs' directory. all files in this directory is copy over while inside initramfs before
  live rootfs boots. btw, any files need to places in home directory, place it in 'liverootfs/etc/skel'.
- run 'mklive.sh' script as root to build the iso.
- use './qemu.sh <your iso>' to test the iso.

NOTE:
- you might want to remove rootfs.sfs & initrd.img file before re-run the 'mklive.sh' script if you modify the rootfs.
- the iso might not work with ventoy, you can use 'cat isofile > /dev/sdX && sync' or dd.

thats all to create custom CRUX live iso.
